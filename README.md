# Number Your Days

## What this project is all about:

This is an app that a friend of mine came up with that we thought would be a great opportunity for me to learn React Native. 

The idea comes from Psalm 90:12 in the Bible, which says:
> *Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.*

The app takes basic personal details as inputs (age, gender, country) and calculates the user's estimated days left to live.

The idea is that, by knowing the number of days we have left to live, we humbly realize that our time on earth is short. This leads to:
1. Not thinking of ourselves too proudly or arrogantly
1. Showing God proper worship by acknowledging his glory, majesty, and holiness above our own
1. Making the most of our lives while we have time

I'm hoping this will be a fun project to learn the basics of React Native, as well as the tools and workflows that *real* developers use.
